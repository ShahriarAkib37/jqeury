        <h1>Why is respect important?</h1>

        <p>
            Giving and receiving respect from others is important because it helps us to feel safe and to express ourselves.
            
            Being respected by important people in our lives growing up teaches us how to be respectful toward others.
            
            Respect means that you accept somebody for who they are, even when they’re different from you or you don’t agree with them.
            
            Respect in your relationships builds feelings of trust, safety, and wellbeing.
            
            Respect doesn’t have to come naturally – it is something you learn.

                    Bangladesh is the birthplace of Friendship and home to the regions where our operations are focussed.

The country was formed at the delta of two of the largest rivers of the world.

Silt deposits from the Himalayas give the soil of Bangladesh its unique fertility, but this geography also leaves the country especially vulnerable to natural disasters.

Twice a year, in the tropical cyclone season, devastating storms form over the Bay of Bengal and batter the southern coast of Bangladesh.

Every monsoon season, the combination of snowmelt from the Himalayas and torrential local rainfall causes catastrophic floods.

Our operations are concentrated in remotest areas of Bangladesh that are at the forefront of many of the global challenges that define our world today, including the climate crisis, lack of access to vital services, inequality and poverty.

Friendship employs some 3200 people in Bangladesh, of whom two thirds are from the communities served by Friendship.
